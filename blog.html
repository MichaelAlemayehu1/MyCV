            Relative Size
        </p>
        <article>
        <p>Yes using relative size (%, em, rem) on styling the size of the element does have a factor in the responsiveness
            of the element. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        
                In using % the size we denote will always be some percentage of the viewport. Like 50%
            width will be 50% of the available width and will not differ on a phone, tablet or any higher
            resolution, and if put in another element it will take 50% of that width.
            When font size for example is increased unlike px unit the size will change accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
                The EM helps maintain responsiveness by maintaining proportionate resizing. If one decides to make font 
            sizes larger or smaller the em length unit will resize and stablize the padding, the width and the like proportionately.
            The em size is relative to the element.
            Similar to % the font size increase or decrease within the browser the size of the fonts will increase accordingly.

        </p>
        <p>
            The rem or root em unit is the font size of the root element. It always remains relative to the root element.
            It is easier since to set size relative to a font size declared on the root element. For example regardless of 
            font size of the parent if a width is set to a certain rem the width will stay the same.

                <li>More Pseudoclass selectors were added. One is the root selector which allows
                    for pointing to the root element of the document. Another is the last child selector 
                    which allows for selection of last element named of a parent element.

                    <p>
                        CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using box shadow property.
                        This allows to specify color, height, width and blur drop shadows on your elements.

                        CSS3 adds a new way for generating linear gradients. Degree specifications can also
                        be made.
